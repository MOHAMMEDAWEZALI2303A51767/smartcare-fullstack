## Interview Talking Points

### When Asked "Tell me about SmartCare"

> "SmartCare is a healthcare platform I built to connect patients with doctors while 
> leveraging AI for health assessments. The platform has three user types - patients, 
> doctors, and admins.
>
> For patients, they can use an AI symptom checker powered by OpenAI GPT-4 that asks 
> follow-up questions and provides possible conditions with urgency levels. They can 
> book appointments, get medicine reminders via email, use an AI diet planner, and 
> access a blood donation network.
>
> Doctors can manage their schedules, conduct video consultations, create prescriptions, 
> and view patient histories.
>
> Technically, it's built with the MERN stack - React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, 
> MongoDB database. I implemented JWT authentication with role-based access, integrated 
> OpenAI's API, set up automated email reminders with cron jobs, and deployed everything 
> on Render and Vercel."

### Technical Deep Dive Questions

**Q: How did you handle authentication?**
> "I used JWT tokens with a dual-token system - short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) 
> and longer-lived refresh tokens (7 days). This provides security while maintaining 
> user experience. I also implemented role-based access control with middleware that 
> checks user roles before allowing access to protected routes."

**Q: How does the AI symptom checker work?**
> "When a patient starts a session, I create a conversation history that's sent to 
> OpenAI's GPT-4 with a system prompt that defines the AI's role as a medical assistant. 
> The AI asks follow-up questions about symptoms, duration, and severity. When the 
> patient completes the assessment, I request a structured JSON response with possible 
> conditions, urgency levels, and recommendations."

**Q: How did you deploy the application?**
> "I deployed the backend on Render as a web service with auto-deploy from GitHub. 
> The frontend is on Vercel with their Git integration. MongoDB is hosted on Atlas. 
> I use environment variables for all sensitive configuration, and the services 
> communicate via HTTPS with proper CORS configuration."
